How to Make Samosa:

Author: Elizabeth Burkhalter

Ingrediants:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
Kosher salt and black pepper
2 cups store-bought refrigerated mashed or frozen mashed potatoes, thawed (about 16 ounces)
1 10-ounce package frozen peas, thawed
1 15-ounce package refrigerated piecrusts
1 jar mango chutney (optional)

Directions:
1. Heat oven to 375° F. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. 
Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes.
Add the curry powder, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring,
until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the potatoes and peas.
2. Unroll the piecrusts and cut each into 6 triangles. Place a heaping tablespoon 
of the potato mixture in the center of each piece. Gather the corners of the dough
and pinch to form a point. Pinch the seams to seal. Transfer to a baking sheet.
3. Bake the samosas until golden, 22 to 25 minutes. Serve with the mango chutney, if using.
